# Memory System

**The unified system memory - what happened, what we learned, what we're working on.**

**Version:** 7.0 (Projects-native architecture, 2026-01-12)
**Location:** `~/.pai/MEMORY/`

---

## Architecture

**Claude Code's `projects/` is the source of truth. Hooks capture domain-specific events directly. Harvesting tools extract learnings from session transcripts.**

```

Claude Code projects/ (native transcript storage - 30-day retention)
    ↓
Hook Events trigger domain-specific captures:
    ├── Algorithm (AI) → WORK/
    ├── RatingCapture → LEARNING/SIGNALS/
    ├── WorkCompletionLearning → LEARNING/
    └── SecurityValidator → SECURITY/
    ↓
Harvesting (periodic):
    ├── SessionHarvester → LEARNING/ (extracts corrections, errors, insights)
    └── LearningPatternSynthesis → LEARNING/SYNTHESIS/ (aggregates ratings)
```

**Key insight:** Hooks write directly to specialized directories. There is no intermediate "firehose" layer - Claude Code's `projects/` serves that purpose natively.

## Directory Details

### Claude Code projects/ - Native Session Storage

**Location:** `~/.claude/projects/-Users-{username}--claude/`
*(Replace `{username}` with your system username, e.g., `-Users-john--claude`)*
**What populates it:** Claude Code automatically (every conversation)
**Content:** Complete session transcripts in JSONL format
**Format:** `{uuid}.jsonl` - one file per session
**Retention:** 30 days (Claude Code manages cleanup)
**Purpose:** Source of truth for all session data; harvesting tools read from here

This is the actual "firehose" - every message, tool call, and response. PAI leverages this native storage rather than duplicating it.

### WORK/ - Primary Work Tracking

**What populates it:**
- Algorithm (AI) creates work dir with PRD.md during execution
- `WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts` on Stop (updates PRD/THREAD)
- `SessionCleanup.hook.ts` on SessionEnd (marks COMPLETED)

**Content:** Flat work directories with a single PRD.md as source of truth
**Format:** `WORK/{timestamp}_{slug}/PRD.md` — consolidated metadata + ISC + decisions + changelog
**Purpose:** Track all discrete work units with lineage, verification, and feedback

**PRD.md Structure (v4.0 — consolidated single file):**
- **YAML frontmatter** — session metadata (id, title, session_id, status, effort_level, completed_at, iteration count, verification_summary)
- **STATUS** — progress table (criteria passing, phase, next action, blockers)
- **APPETITE** — time budget, circuit breaker, ISC target count
- **CONTEXT** — problem space from user prompt, key files
- **RISKS & RABBIT HOLES** — populated during THINK phase
- **PLAN** — populated during PLAN phase
- **IDEAL STATE CRITERIA** — checkbox markdown (`- [x]`/`- [ ]`) as system of record
- **DECISIONS** — non-obvious technical decisions logged during BUILD/EXECUTE
- **CHANGELOG** — timestamped entries replacing THREAD.md

**Work Directory Lifecycle:**
1. Algorithm execution → AI creates work dir with PRD.md (frontmatter includes session metadata)
2. `PostToolUse` → PRDSync syncs PRD frontmatter to work.json on Write/Edit
3. `SessionEnd` → SessionCleanup marks PRD status COMPLETED, clears state

**Note:** Legacy work directories (pre-2026-02-22) may have META.yaml, ISC.json, THREAD.md alongside PRD.md. All consumers check PRD.md frontmatter first, fall back to legacy files.

### LEARNING/ - Categorized Learnings

**What populates it:**
- `RatingCapture.hook.ts` (explicit ratings + implicit sentiment + low-rating learnings)
- `WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts` (significant work session completions)
- `SessionHarvester.ts` (periodic extraction from projects/ transcripts)
- `LearningPatternSynthesis.ts` (aggregates ratings into pattern reports)

**Structure:**
- `LEARNING/SYSTEM/YYYY-MM/` - PAI/tooling learnings (infrastructure issues)
- `LEARNING/ALGORITHM/YYYY-MM/` - Task execution learnings (approach errors)
- `LEARNING/SYNTHESIS/YYYY-MM/` - Aggregated pattern analysis (weekly/monthly reports)
- `LEARNING/REFLECTIONS/algorithm-reflections.jsonl` - Algorithm performance reflections (Q1/Q2/Q3 from LEARN phase)
- `LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` - All user satisfaction ratings
- `LEARNING/FEEDBACK/feedback_*.md` - PAI-native behavioral feedback memories (flat .md files with YAML frontmatter)

**Categorization logic:**
| Directory | When Used | Example Triggers |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| `SYSTEM/` | Tooling/infrastructure failures | hook crash, config error, deploy failure |
| `ALGORITHM/` | Task execution issues | wrong approach, over-engineered, missed the point |
| `FAILURES/` | Full context for low ratings (1-3) | severe frustration, repeated errors |
| `REFLECTIONS/` | Algorithm performance analysis | per-session 3-question reflection from LEARN phase |
| `SYNTHESIS/` | Pattern aggregation | weekly analysis, recurring issues |
| `FEEDBACK/` | Behavioral feedback memories (PAI-native) | DO-MORE patterns accepted via `/learn apply`; hand-written feedback |

### LEARNING/FAILURES/ - Full Context Failure Analysis

**What populates it:**
- `RatingCapture.hook.ts` via `FailureCapture.ts` (for ratings 1-3)
- Manual migration via `bun FailureCapture.ts --migrate`

**Content:** Complete context dumps for low-sentiment events
**Format:** `FAILURES/YYYY-MM/{timestamp}_{8-word-description}/`
**Purpose:** Enable retroactive learning system analysis by preserving full context

**Each failure directory contains:**
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Human-readable analysis with metadata, root cause notes |
| `transcript.jsonl` | Full raw conversation up to the failure point |
| `sentiment.json` | Sentiment analysis output (rating, confidence, detailed analysis) |
| `tool-calls.json` | Extracted tool calls with inputs and outputs |

**Directory naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_eight-word-description-from-inference`
- Timestamp in PST
- 8-word description generated by fast inference to capture failure essence

**Rating thresholds:**
| Rating | Capture Level |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Full failure capture + learning file |
| 2 | Full failure capture + learning file |
| 3 | Full failure capture + learning file |
| 4-5 | Learning file only (if warranted) |
| 6-10 | No capture (positive/neutral) |

**Why this exists:** When significant frustration occurs (1-3), a brief summary isn't enough. Full context enables:
1. Root cause identification - what sequence led to the failure?
2. Pattern detection - do similar failures share characteristics?
3. Systemic improvement - what changes would prevent this class of failure?

### LEARNING/FEEDBACK/ - PAI-Native Behavioral Feedback Memories

**What populates it:**
- `/learn apply` workflow (Packs/Learning/src/Workflows/Apply.md, Step 7) when a DO-MORE behavioral pattern is accepted
- Hand-written feedback files placed directly under this directory by the user

**Content:** Flat `.md` files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `type: feedback`) and a free-form body describing the behavior to reinforce
**Format:** `feedback_{short_slug}.md` — no month buckets (feedback memories are durable, low-volume, and globally relevant across cwds)
**Purpose:** Path B home for PAI-native behavioral feedback under issue #109. Replaces the prior per-cwd siloing of feedback memories under `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/memory/feedback_*.md`, which was mislabeled as "the PAI memory directory" in pre-Part-1 Apply.md.

**Readback at SessionStart:** `learning-readback.ts → loadFeedbackMemories(count)` reads the N most recent files by filename-sort-descending, extracts `name` + `description`, and surfaces them via `LoadContext.hook.ts` in the same `<system-reminder>` block as the other learning readback sections. Controlled by the `dynamicContext.learningReadback` flag in `settings.json` (default: enabled).

**Migration status:** Existing pre-Part-1 feedback files under `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/feedback_*.md` are left dormant. They are no longer the authoritative home for new feedback. A user who wants the pre-existing files re-surfaced at SessionStart can copy them manually into `~/.pai/MEMORY/LEARNING/FEEDBACK/`. No automated migration is provided — the prior files remain readable via their original mechanism.

### RESEARCH/ - Agent Outputs

**What populates it:** Agent tasks write directly to this directory
**Content:** Agent completion outputs (researchers, architects, engineers, etc.)
**Format:** `RESEARCH/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_AGENT-type_description.md`
**Purpose:** Archive of all spawned agent work

### SECURITY/ - Security Events

**What populates it:** `SecurityValidator.hook.ts` on tool validation
**Content:** Security audit events (blocks, confirmations, alerts)
**Format:** `SECURITY/security-events.jsonl`
**Purpose:** Security decision audit trail

### STATE/ - Fast Runtime Data

**What populates it:** Various tools and hooks
**Content:** High-frequency read/write JSON files for runtime state
**Key Property:** Ephemeral - can be rebuilt from RAW or other sources. Optimized for speed, not permanence.

**Key contents:**
- `algorithms/` - Per-session algorithm state files (`{sessionId}.json` — phase, criteria, effort level, active flag)
- `kitty-sessions/` - Per-session Kitty terminal env (`{sessionId}.json` — listenOn, windowId for tab control and voice gating)
- `tab-titles/` - Per-window tab state (`{windowId}.json` — title, color, phase for daemon recovery)
- `session-names.json` - Auto-generated session names from SessionAutoName hook
- `current-work.json` - Active work directory pointer
- `format-streak.json`, `algorithm-streak.json` - Performance metrics
- `progress/` - Multi-session project tracking
- `integrity/` - System health check results

This is mutable state that changes during execution - not historical records. If deleted, system recovers gracefully.

**`events.jsonl` - Unified Event Log:**

An append-only JSONL file where hooks emit structured, typed events alongside their normal state writes. Each line is a JSON object with `timestamp`, `session_id`, `source`, `type`, and type-specific fields. The type field uses a dot-separated topic hierarchy (e.g., `algorithm.phase`, `work.created`, `rating.captured`, `voice.sent`). This file is an observability layer -- it does NOT replace any of the mutable state files listed above. Events are written by `${PAI_DIR}/hooks/lib/event-emitter.ts` using synchronous append, and errors are silently swallowed so the event log never disrupts hook execution. Consumers can tail or `fs.watch` this file for real-time visibility into PAI activity.

### PAISYSTEMUPDATES/ - Change History

**What populates it:** Manual via CreateUpdate.ts tool
**Content:** Canonical tracking of all system changes
**Purpose:** Track architectural decisions and system changes over time

## Hook Integration

| Hook | Trigger | Writes To |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Algorithm (AI) | During execution | WORK/PRD.md, STATE/current-work-{sessionId}.json |
| PRDSync.hook.ts | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | STATE/work.json (syncs PRD frontmatter) |
| WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts | SessionEnd | LEARNING/ (significant work) |

| RatingCapture.hook.ts | UserPromptSubmit | LEARNING/SIGNALS/, LEARNING/, FAILURES/ (1-3) |
| SecurityValidator.hook.ts | PreToolUse | SECURITY/ |

> **Note:** All hooks listed above also emit typed events to `STATE/events.jsonl` via `appendEvent()`. See [THEHOOKSYSTEM.md § Unified Event System](THEHOOKSYSTEM.md) for event types and consumer details.

## Harvesting Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Reads From | Writes To |
|------|---------|------------|-----------|
