# PAI Voice System v1.0.0 - Installation Guide

**This guide is designed for AI agents installing this pack into a user's infrastructure.**

---

## AI Agent Instructions

**This is a wizard-style installation.** Use Claude Code's native tools to guide the user through installation:

1. **AskUserQuestion** - For user decisions and confirmations
2. **TodoWrite** - For progress tracking
3. **Bash/Read/Write** - For actual installation
4. **VERIFY.md** - For final validation

### Welcome Message

Before starting, greet the user:
```
"I'm installing PAI Voice System v1.0.0 - Text-to-speech voice output for your AI assistant using ElevenLabs.

Let me analyze your system and guide you through installation."
```

---

## Phase 1: System Analysis

**Execute this analysis BEFORE any file operations.**

### 1.1 Run These Commands

```bash
# Check for PAI directory
PAI_CHECK="${PAI_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"
echo "PAI_DIR: $PAI_CHECK"

# Check if pai-core-install is installed (REQUIRED)
if [ -f "$PAI_CHECK/skills/CORE/SKILL.md" ]; then
  echo "✓ pai-core-install is installed"
else
  echo "❌ pai-core-install NOT installed - REQUIRED!"
fi

# Check if pai-hook-system is installed (REQUIRED)
if [ -f "$PAI_CHECK/hooks/lib/observability.ts" ]; then
  echo "✓ pai-hook-system is installed"
else
  echo "❌ pai-hook-system NOT installed - REQUIRED!"
fi

# Check for existing VoiceServer
if [ -d "$PAI_CHECK/VoiceServer" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Existing VoiceServer found at: $PAI_CHECK/VoiceServer"
  ls -la "$PAI_CHECK/VoiceServer/"
else
  echo "✓ No existing VoiceServer (clean install)"
fi

# Check for Bun runtime
if command -v bun &> /dev/null; then
  echo "✓ Bun is installed: $(bun --version)"
else
  echo "❌ Bun not installed - REQUIRED!"
fi

# Check for ElevenLabs API key
echo ""
echo "API Key Status:"
[ -n "$ELEVENLABS_API_KEY" ] && echo "✓ ELEVENLABS_API_KEY: Set" || echo "⚠️  ELEVENLABS_API_KEY: NOT SET (required for voice)"

# Check for port availability
if lsof -i :8888 &> /dev/null; then
  echo "⚠️  Port 8888 is in use"
  lsof -i :8888 | head -3
else
  echo "✓ Port 8888 is available (voice server)"
fi

# Check macOS audio
if command -v afplay &> /dev/null; then
  echo "✓ afplay available (macOS audio)"
else
  echo "⚠️  afplay not found (may need alternative audio player)"
fi
```

### 1.2 Present Findings

Tell the user what you found:
```
"Here's what I found on your system:
- pai-core-install: [installed / NOT INSTALLED - REQUIRED]
- pai-hook-system: [installed / NOT INSTALLED - REQUIRED]
- Existing VoiceServer: [Yes at path / No]
- Bun runtime: [installed vX.X / NOT INSTALLED - REQUIRED]
- ELEVENLABS_API_KEY: [set / not set]
- Port 8888: [available / in use]
- Audio playback: [afplay available / not available]"
```

**STOP if pai-core-install, pai-hook-system, or Bun is not installed.** Tell the user:
```
"pai-core-install and pai-hook-system are required. Please install them first, then return to install this pack.

Install order:
1. pai-core-install
2. pai-hook-system
3. pai-voice-system (this pack)"
```

  "header": "Conflict",
  "question": "Existing VoiceServer detected. How should I proceed?",
  "multiSelect": false,
  "options": [
    {"label": "Backup and Replace (Recommended)", "description": "Creates timestamped backup, then installs new version"},
    {"label": "Replace Without Backup", "description": "Overwrites existing without backup"},
    {"label": "Abort Installation", "description": "Cancel installation, keep existing"}
  ]
}
```

### Question 2: ElevenLabs Setup

**Only ask if ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is not set:**

```json
{
  "header": "API Key",
  "question": "ElevenLabs API key not found. How should I proceed?",
  "multiSelect": false,
  "options": [
    {"label": "Create .env template (Recommended)", "description": "Creates template file for you to add API key later"},
    {"label": "I'll set it manually", "description": "Skip .env creation, set key in shell profile"},
    {"label": "Continue without voice", "description": "Install server but voice won't work until key is set"}
  ]
}
```

### Question 3: Auto-Start Configuration

```json
{
  "header": "Auto-Start",
  "question": "How should the voice server start?",
  "multiSelect": false,
  "options": [
    {"label": "Manual start (Recommended)", "description": "Start with manage.sh when you want voice output"},
    {"label": "Start on login", "description": "Create a LaunchAgent to auto-start (macOS only)"}
  ]
}
```

### Question 4: Final Confirmation

```json

## Usage

### Starting the Voice Server

```bash
# Start
$PAI_DIR/VoiceServer/manage.sh start

# Check status
$PAI_DIR/VoiceServer/manage.sh status

# Stop
$PAI_DIR/VoiceServer/manage.sh stop

# Restart
$PAI_DIR/VoiceServer/manage.sh restart
```

### Testing Voice Output

```bash
# Send a test notification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, this is a test."}'
```

### From Claude Code

Once installed, the voice system works automatically:
- Your AI's 🗣️ response line is spoken aloud
- Subagent completions are announced
- Session endings are narrated

### CLI Examples

```bash
# Quick notification
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Task completed successfully."}' \
  > /dev/null 2>&1 &

# With specific speaker/voice
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Research complete.", "speaker": "Intern"}'
```

## Voice Personalities

The voice system supports multiple agent voices via `voice-personalities.md`:

| Agent | Voice Style |
|-------|-------------|
| Main Assistant | Default configured voice |
| Intern | Slightly faster, enthusiastic |
| Architect | Measured, thoughtful pace |
| Engineer | Clear, technical tone |

Configure voices in `$PAI_DIR/skills/CORE/voice-personalities.md` (canonical location).

The server looks for configuration in this order:
1. `$PAI_DIR/skills/CORE/voice-personalities.md` (recommended)
2. `$PAI_DIR/VoiceServer/voice-personalities.json` (fallback)

---

## Auto-Start on Login (macOS)

If you chose auto-start during installation, a LaunchAgent was created:

```bash
# Check LaunchAgent status
launchctl list | grep pai-voice

# View LaunchAgent
cat ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pai.voice-server.plist

# Reload if needed
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pai.voice-server.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pai.voice-server.plist
```

---
